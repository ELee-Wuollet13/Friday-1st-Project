      <p>My first week at Epicodus was exciting!<br>
      We learned:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How to make a webpage</li>
        <li>How to make it fancy with pictures and color</li>
        <li>How to add block elements, collums improts from bootstrap
          (whcih has so far made me think of 'bootstrap bill' from Pirates of the Carribean every time)</li>
          <li>And perhaps most importantly we have learned to save our work to GitHub so that no matter what
            happens on our computers, what we have made is safe and sound</li>
            <p>The rapid changes in learning pace have been a bit jarring. On my first day I felt like I was picking things up slowly
              in git, but quicker in actual code. Second day I worked with two partners who knew what they were doing and we flew through the lesson
              third day I worked with two more advanced partners again. It was nice to see it done effectively, avoiding the first days frustrations
              was a welcome change but has now left me with a fair amount of review.
