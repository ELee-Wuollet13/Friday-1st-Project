            <li>How to make a <strong>webpage</strong></li>
            <li>How to make it fancy with pictures and color</li>
            <li>How to add block elements, collums improts from bootstrap (whcih
              has so far made me think of
              'bootstrap bill' from Pirates of the Carribean)</li>
              <li>And perhaps most importantly we have learned to save our work to
                GitHub so that no matter what
                happens on our computers, what we have made is safe and
                sound</li><br><br>

            <ul>
              <li>The rapid changes in learning pace have been a bit jarring</li>
              <li>On my first day I felt like I was picking git up slowly,
                but <span class="html">HTML</span> made sense</li>
                <li>On the second day I worked with two more experiences
                  partners and we practiced Git pushing while learning
                  new <span class="html">HTML</span> machanics
                  and to a certain extent the pace and my own newness to
                  coding kept me from retaining some of the new elements</li>
                  <li>Day three I worked with another pair of more advanced
                    students and while I enjoyed getting to know them I will be
                    revisiting some of the elements we worked on</li>
                    <li>Overall I feel my grasp of Git and
                      basic <span class="html">HTML</span> are strong, with more
                      complex <span class="html">HTML</span> and
                      CSS requiring some review</li>
