          <h1>About me:</h1>
        </div>
        <p>My name is Everett, <br>I'm a Portland Native, just turned thirty and trading
          in the pipe and amateur philosofy for something more creative and engaging (and lucretive).
          I'm an avid comsumer of most forms of art media and tend to approach most things with a critical eye for
          quality. Since pot has been a fairly time consuming hobby for a while I'm open to aquiring new ones.
          <br>I'm inclined to give everyone a chance, don't believe in judging others based on what they cannot control
          but comfortable judging based on actions. If I find the success I'm hoping for the the tech industry
          I plan to volunteer and donate to non-profit causes focusing around homelessness and people with disabilities.</p>

          <div class="collums">
            <h2 class="listheader">We learned:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>How to make a <strong>webpage</strong></li>
              <li>How to make it fancy with pictures and color</li>
              <li>How to add block elements, collums improts from bootstrap (whcih
                has so far made me think of
                'bootstrap bill' from Pirates of the Carribean)</li>
                <li>And perhaps most importantly we have learned to save our work to
                  GitHub so that no matter what
                  happens on our computers, what we have made is safe and
                  sound</li><br><br>

              <h2 class="listheader">The week in review:</h2>

              <ul>
                <li>The rapid changes in learning pace have been a bit jarring</li>
                <li>On my first day I felt like I was picking git up slowly,
                  but <span class="html">HTML</span> made sense</li>
                  <li>On the second day I worked with two more experiences
                    partners and we practiced Git pushing while learning
                    new <span class="html">HTML</span> machanics
                    and to a certain extent the pace and my own newness to
                    coding kept me from retaining some of the new elements</li>
                    <li>Day three I worked with another pair of more advanced
                      students and while I enjoyed getting to know them I will be
                      revisiting some of the elements we worked on</li>
                      <li>Overall I feel my grasp of Git and
                        basic <span class="html">HTML</span> are strong, with more
                        complex <span class="html">HTML</span> and
                        CSS requiring some review</li>
                      </ul>
