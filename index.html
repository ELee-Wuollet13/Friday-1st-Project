    <p>My first week at Epicodus was exciting!
      We learned how to make a webpage, how to make it fancy with pictures and color,
      how to add block elements, collums, improts from bootstrap
      (whcih has so far made me think of 'bootstrap bill' from Pirates of the Carribean every time)
      and perhaps most importantly we have learned to save our work to GitHub so that no matter what
      happens on our computers, what we have made is safe and sound.
    </p>
    <p>The rapid changes in learning pace have been a bit jarring. On my first day I felt like I was picking things up slowly
      in git, but quicker in actual code. Second day I worked with two partners who knew what they were doing and we flew through the lesson
      third day I worked with two more advanced partners again. It was nice to see it done effectively, avoiding the first days frustrations
      was a welcome change but has now left me with a fair amount of review.
