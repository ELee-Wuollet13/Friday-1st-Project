    <h1>Week one portfolio: Everett Lee-Wuollet</h1>
    <p>Dear Diary: My first week at Epicodus was exciting!
      We learned how to make a webpage, how to make it fancy with pictures and color,
    how to add block elements, collums, improts from bootstrap
    (whcih has so far made me think of 'bootstrap bill' from Pirates of the Carribean every time)
    and perhaps most importantly we have learned to save our work to GitHub so that no matter what
    happens on our computers, what we have made is safe and sound.
