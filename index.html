      <h3>My first week at Epicodus was exciting!</h3>
      <h2 class="listheader">We learned:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How to make a webpage</li>
        <li>How to make it fancy with pictures and color</li>
        <li>How to add block elements, collums improts from bootstrap (whcih has so far made me think of 'bootstrap bill' from Pirates of the Carribean every time)</li>
        <li>And perhaps most importantly we have learned to save our work to GitHub so that no matter what
            happens on our computers, what we have made is safe and sound</li><br><br>
            <h2 class="listheader">The week in review:</h2>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>The rapid changes in learning pace have been a bit jarring</li>
        <li>On my first day I felt like I was picking git up slowly, but <em>HTML</em> made sense</li>
              <li>On the second day I worked with two more experiences partners and we practiced Git pushing while learning new HTML machanics
                and to a certain extent the pace and my own newness to coding kept me from retaining some of the new elements</li>
                <li>Day three I worked with another pair of more advanced students and while I enjoyed getting to know them I will be
                  revisiting some of the elements we worked on</li>
                  <li>Overall I feel my grasp of Git and basic HTML are strong, with more complex HTML and CSS requiring some review</li>
                </ol>
